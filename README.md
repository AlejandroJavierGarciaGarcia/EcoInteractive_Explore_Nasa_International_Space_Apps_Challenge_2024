# EcoInteractive Hub üåç

**EcoInteractive Hub** is an educational platform designed to connect people with the environment through interactive games based on real-world data and scientific protocols from the GLOBE Program. Our goal is to inspire continuous learning and environmental action, fostering global awareness and sustainability.

## Project Description

This project aims to provide users, especially children and young people, with an interactive experience that connects them to environmental science. Using real data and protocols from GLOBE, users can explore, play, and learn about the state of the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and pedosphere.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Exploration:** Educational games that simulate real-time environmental studies.
- **GLOBE Scientific Protocols:** Over 100 protocols in areas like the atmosphere, carbon cycle, water, and soil quality.
- **Scientific Missions:** Users participate in missions like "Carbon Mission" and "Steam Hunters," immersing them in environmental research.

### Featured Games

1. **Carbon Mission:** Players shrink themselves to study the carbon cycle across various ecosystems.
2. **Steam Hunters:** They time travel using sunlight waves to collect water vapor data in different geographical locations.
3. **pH Guardians:** They save a planet by balancing pH levels in aquatic ecosystems.
4. **Cloud Factory:** Challenges where players manage a cloud factory using real weather patterns.

## Project Objectives

- **Promote Citizen Science:** Enable users to contribute to environmental data collection that can be used in real-world scientific studies.
- **Raise Awareness about Climate Change:** Teach how our actions impact the environment, aiming to inspire changes in daily behavior.
- **Enhance Environmental Education:** Engage young people through accessible games and protocols to learn about Earth and its conservation.
