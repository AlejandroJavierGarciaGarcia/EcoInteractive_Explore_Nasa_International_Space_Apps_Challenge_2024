## About EcoInteractive Explore üå±

From a young age, video games have captured our attention and passion. We firmly believe that when young people have fun and are taught in an interactive way with attractive graphics, their ability to retain information improves significantly. Therefore, we have created **EcoInteractive Explore**, a prototype online educational platform.

**EcoInteractive Explore** is a website where users can find a catalog of educational video games. Although it is currently a prototype, our vision for the future is to develop a video game for each of the **GLOBE protocols**, allowing young people to choose the protocol they wish to learn in an interactive and entertaining way.

### What Do We Hope to Achieve?

Our goal is to create a comprehensive website that houses all the games related to the **GLOBE protocols**, offering truly interactive experiences. Regardless of the support we may receive, our goal is to develop an **open-source platform** where people of all ages can access, learn about the protocols, and deepen their knowledge of the ecosystem. In this way, we aim not only to educate but also to inspire users to improve their communities through greater environmental awareness.

This project is highly scalable and has the potential to help young people discover and foster their curiosity for science, becoming **agents of change** in their environments.
